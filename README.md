# PulseCursor AutoClicker (Concept Version)

This AutoClicker is an experimental concept developed as part of the PulseCursor project. It explores the possibility of creating a Hold-to-Click AutoClicker and its compatibility with various anti-cheat systems. However, please note that this AutoClicker is not actively maintained and will not receive updates.

# Purpose

The primary aim of this AutoClicker was to assess the feasibility of implementing advanced clicking functionalities while holding down the mouse button, particularly in gaming scenarios. It was created to gauge the potential effectiveness of such mechanisms in bypassing anti-cheat systems.

# Important Note:

This concept version of the AutoClicker is provided as-is, without any guarantees of functionality or support. It serves as a basic demonstration of the idea and should not be relied upon for critical tasks.
